# Description of the project.
desc: >
  Our project is an interactive single-player Blackjack system. It simulates a 
  Blackjack game with rules such as 4 to 8 playing decks, no "hole card" for the 
  dealer, dealer hits until achieving a value of 17 or more, and a 2-1 Blackjack 
  payout. 
  
  The game supports traditional player decisions such as hitting, standing, 
  doubling down, splitting, and surrendering as well as a betting mechanism to 
  create a thrilling risk/reward experience. The user interface of the Blackjack 
  game is fully text-based, and players can interact with the the interface by 
  typing specific commands in the terminal. The game also offers an evaluation 
  tool that suggests the recommended action to take and the recommended betting 
  size, which is based on popular Blackjack strategy charts and a HighLow card 
  counting system.

  We improve the odds against the dealer compared to traditional casino Blackjack 
  odds to truly reward the player's skill. Do you have what it takes to beat the 
  dealer?
