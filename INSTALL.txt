INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLACKJACK SYSTEM
Preface.
- Notes on command formatting: Commands to execute are enclosed in square brackets 
  with the format [command], but do not include the square brackets themselves. 
  Copy only the text inside the square brackets for each command.
- These instructions assume that blackjack.zip has been downloaded and unzipped
  by the user in a directory navigable in Ubuntu.
- These instructions assume that OCaml and Ubuntu have been installed correctly.

  Note: If OCaml and Ubuntu are not installed, it is highly recommended to follow
  the installation instructions on:
  
  https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/preface/install.html

  to ensure that all necessary packages are correctly installed for the Blackjack
  system.

Installation.
1. Open Ubuntu and navigate into the blackjack directory. All subsequent commands 
   should be run in this directory.

2. Install the latest version of ANSITerminal: 
   On Unix and OSX, run the command [opam install ANSITerminal].
   On Windows, please follow the installation instructions on 
   https://github.com/Chris00/ANSITerminal for cloning the repository and compiling
   and installing the library.

   Note: The version of ANSITerminal used during the development of the Blackjack
   system was version 0.8.5, but any future version should also work. To install
   ANSITerminal version 0.8.5, run the command [opam install ANSITerminal.0.8.5].

   Additionally, it may be necessary to update any OCaml packages prior to 
   installing ANSITerminal by running [opam update] (this command may take 
   several minutes to complete), then [opam upgrade] to upgrade already-installed 
   packages.

3. In the terminal, run the command [make build]. "dune build" should appear on
   the terminal afterwards.

4. To play the Blackjack system in the terminal, run the command [make play].
   You should see a yellow/gold welcome message for the Blackjack system.
   Congratulations, you have successfully started a Blackjack session!
